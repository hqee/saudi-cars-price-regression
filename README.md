## Project Overview

The used car market in Saudi Arabia is dynamic and often inconsistent. A common issue is **price uncertainty**, especially when sellers leave prices listed as "0" or "Negotiable". This creates inefficiencies and makes it difficult for buyers and sellers to identify a fair market price.

This project builds a **Machine Learning Regression Model** to estimate the fair value of used cars based on attributes like Make, Model, Year, Mileage, Transmission, Region, and Engine Size.

**Business Impact:**

- **For Sellers:** Set competitive and accurate listing prices.
- **For Buyers:** Detect overpriced listings and negotiate with data.
- **For Marketplaces:** Filter low-quality or zero-price listings automatically.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Cleaning

Key domain-driven cleaning steps:

- Removed rows where `Price = 0` or marked as `Negotiable`.
- Removed duplicate listings.
- Imputed missing categorical values using mode.
- Standardized inconsistent fields like Year and Mileage.

### 2. Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline

A full Scikit-Learn Pipeline with ColumnTransformer was used.

| Feature Type                                 | Method          | Reason                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| High-Cardinality Categoricals (Make, Region) | Binary Encoding | Reduces dimensionality while preserving category meaning |
| Low-Cardinality Categoricals (Gear, Origin)  | OneHot Encoding | Best for small category sets                             |
| Numerical (Mileage, Engine, Year)            | Robust Scaler   | Handles heavy outliers better than StandardScaler        |

### 3. Model Benchmarking

Five algorithms were compared with 5-Fold Cross-Validation:

- Ridge Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- **CatBoost (Best Model)**

CatBoost was then optimized using hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best RMSE.

## Model Performance

Evaluated on a separate 20 percent test set.

| Metric   | Score          | Meaning                                       |
| -------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **R²**   | **0.8754**     | Model explains 87.5 percent of price variance |
| **MAE**  | **14,306 SAR** | Average deviation from actual prices          |
| **RMSE** | **26,544 SAR** | Captures impact of high-outlier prices        |
